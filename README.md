This project is called "Library". It includes several entities: student, librarian, books. The librarian acts as an administrator, 
he has certain rights that will be available to him if he correctly enters his username and password. 
The librarian can add, delete and edit information about books, display information about the entire library, etc.
The student can register in the system using his ID, full name and password. 
The student can take books home and return them back. During the work on the Library project, each of the three teammates made a great contribution.
